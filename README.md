Code branched from:

http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/calib3d/camera_calibration/camera_calibration.html



# How to use:   

`cmake .`  
`make`    
and then:  `./CalibrateCamera filename.xml`  
The file should exist before you run this.

also be sure to configure the `.xml` file with the data you want, whether you're calibrating with a chessboard, or via a camera or with video.
